Intention : To learn and code the basic outlines of some important Design Patterns known.

Patterns to learn :
1. Chain of responsibility
2. Observer

3. Iterator:
Ways to implement the iterator :
	1. Using an inner class
	2. Making the ContainerIterator class extend Container class
	3. Implement an Iterator interface and then make Container class implement it.

TODO : Find out the best approach by looking into the Java Library.

4. Singleton
